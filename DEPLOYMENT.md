### 4. Build Commands

#### Automated Build (Recommended)
The easiest way to build the app is using our automated build script:

```bash
./build-android.sh
```

This script will:
- Automatically download and set up Android SDK
- Accept all required licenses
- Install necessary packages (NDK, build-tools, platforms)
- Create local.properties file
- Build the release AAB file

#### Manual Build (Advanced Users)
If you prefer manual setup or already have Android SDK installed:

1. **Install Android SDK** (if not already installed):
```bash
# Download Android SDK Command Line Tools
mkdir android-sdk && cd android-sdk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-linux-11076708_latest.zip
unzip commandlinetools-linux-11076708_latest.zip
mkdir -p cmdline-tools && mv cmdline-tools cmdline-tools/latest

# Set environment variables
export ANDROID_HOME="$(pwd)"
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"

# Accept licenses and install required packages
yes | sdkmanager --licenses
sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0" "ndk;25.1.8937393"
```

2. **Create local.properties** (if doesn't exist):
```bash
echo "sdk.dir=$ANDROID_HOME" > android/local.properties
```

#### Generate Release AAB
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android-sdk
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

#### Generate Release APK (for testing)
```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android-sdk
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Note**: The built AAB file will be located at:
`android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
