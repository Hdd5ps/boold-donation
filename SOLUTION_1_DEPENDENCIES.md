# ðŸš€ SOLUTION 1: Fix Missing Dependencies

## Problem Identified
The build fails because React Native package dependencies are missing. The autolinking system can't find the required native modules.

## Immediate Fix

### Step 1: Install Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Install all required React Native packages
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
npm install @react-native-community/netinfo
npm install react-native-date-picker
npm install react-native-geolocation-service
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
npm install react-native-image-picker
npm install react-native-linear-gradient
npm install react-native-maps
npm install react-native-permissions
npm install react-native-push-notification
npm install react-native-safe-area-context
npm install react-native-screens
npm install react-native-vector-icons

# For iOS (if building for iOS later)
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Step 2: Re-link Packages
```bash
# Clear autolinking cache
rm -rf android/app/build/generated/autolinking/
npx react-native unlink-all
npx react-native link

# Clean and rebuild
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Build APK
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Alternative: Manual Package.json Update

If you want to update package.json directly:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.0",
    "@react-native-community/netinfo": "^9.4.0",
    "react-native-date-picker": "^4.3.0",
    "react-native-geolocation-service": "^5.3.0",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.12.0",
    "react-native-image-picker": "^5.6.0",
    "react-native-linear-gradient": "^2.8.0",
    "react-native-maps": "^1.7.0",
    "react-native-permissions": "^3.8.0",
    "react-native-push-notification": "^8.1.0",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^4.7.0",
    "react-native-screens": "^3.22.0",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm install
npx react-native link
```

## Expected Result
âœ… All dependencies properly linked  
âœ… Autolinking works correctly  
âœ… APK builds successfully  
âœ… App functions with all features
