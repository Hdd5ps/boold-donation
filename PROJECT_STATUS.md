## üîÑ CURRENT STATUS

### Build Progress
- ‚úÖ JavaScript bundling: **WORKING** - Metro bundler successfully creates JS bundle
- ‚úÖ Android SDK setup: **COMPLETE** - All tools and licenses properly configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Autolinking Issue**: React Native 0.75 autolinking configuration needs resolution

### Known Issue
The build currently fails at the autolinking step with the error:
```
RNGP - Autolinking: Could not find project.android.packageName in react-native config output!
```

This is a known issue with React Native 0.75+ and the new autolinking system. The project structure and configuration are correct, but the gradle plugin has specific requirements for the React Native config output format.

## üõ†Ô∏è TO RESOLVE BUILD ISSUE

### Option 1: Manual Autolinking (Recommended)
1. Disable automatic autolinking
2. Manually configure each native module in MainApplication.java
3. Update android/settings.gradle to include modules

### Option 2: Downgrade React Native
1. Downgrade to React Native 0.74.x where autolinking is more stable
2. Update all dependencies to compatible versions

### Option 3: Fix Autolinking Config
1. Modify react-native.config.js structure
2. Update gradle plugin configuration
3. Ensure config output matches expected format

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READINESS

### What's Ready for Play Store
- Complete Android app with all functionality
- Proper package structure and naming
- Release keystore and signing configuration
- All required permissions and manifest entries
- App icons and resources
- Build automation scripts

### Post-Build Steps (Once build issue is resolved)
1. Test the generated APK/AAB file
2. Upload to Google Play Console
3. Complete store listing with provided marketing materials
4. Submit for review
